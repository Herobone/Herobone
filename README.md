### Hi there 👋
I'm a student from beautiful Bavaria in Germany. Currently I am learning for my Abitur and coding on some small projects.
Im a small freelancing Software Developer, mainly focused on Web-Development

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Sober Sailor](https://github.com/Herobone/Sober-Sailor) and [Cloud Craft](https://github.com/Herobone/CloudCraft)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning for my Abitur 🙁
- 💬 Ask me about **React, Go, GCP, Firebase**
- ⚡ Fun fact: Don't look for fancy colors in my projects. I'm colorblind
